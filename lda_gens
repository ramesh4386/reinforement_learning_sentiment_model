# Step 1: Prepare the text data
documents = [
    "The sky is blue",
    "The sun is bright",
    "The sky is cloudy",
    "I love to watch the stars",
    "I enjoy going to the beach"

# Step 2: Preprocess the text data
processed_docs = [simple_preprocess(doc) for doc in documents]

# Step 3: Create a dictionary from the preprocessed documents
dictionary = corpora.Dictionary(processed_docs)

# Step 4: Convert the preprocessed documents into a bag-of-words corpus
bow_corpus = [dictionary.doc2bow(doc) for doc in processed_docs]

# Step 5: Train the LDA model
lda_model = LdaModel(bow_corpus, num_topics=2, id2word=dictionary, passes=10)

# Step 6: Extract topics from a document
doc = "The sky is blue"
doc_preprocessed = simple_preprocess(doc)
doc_bow = dictionary.doc2bow(doc_preprocessed)
topics = lda_model.get_document_topics(doc_bow)

# Step 7: Print the topics and their probabilities
for topic in topics:
    print(f"Topic {topic[0]}: {topic[1]}")
